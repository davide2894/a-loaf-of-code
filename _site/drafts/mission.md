## Mission
Why another coding blog? I want to document my journey from solo learner to professional web developer, I want to prove that it's possible and that everybody can. And while I do it I want to contribute to our learning.

## Planned contents
- walkthroughs on projects I built and tutorials
- my difficulties 
- what I'm up to
- interviews with pros
- document the scholarship I'm in right now, the Google Developer Scholarship sponsored by Google and taught via Udacit y

And much more. I decided to be open for whatever I'll come up to.

## Name
Bread crumbs is web development in two words. Because you never stop to learn. When you think you know it all, that's the time you realize there is so much more to learn. This picture from Family Guy sums it up pretty well

I tried breadcrumbs.com but of course it was already taken. Do you know a way to express this concept in other words?

The name must reflect that. I'm a regular guy who is trying to change his life with code. I want to document my journey and help those who are doing the same to learn. I just want to prove I can, that everybody can. So it should be something "down to earth". 

These are what I could think of:
* Morning Dev ->morningdev.com
* Dev Davide -> devdavide.com
* Change it with code -> changeitwithcode.com
* Change with code -> changewithcode.com
* The regular dev -> theregulardev.com
* Coding Crumbs -> codingcrumbs.com but I think this would conflict with codingphase.com

John, be honest please: am I thinking this too much? I mean, would it be generic to use davideiaiunese.com as a single domain to host both portfolio and blog?

Thank you for the time you're dedicating to me.
