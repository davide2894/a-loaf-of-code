<p>You want to become a developer. I encourage you to look for new opportunities.</p>

<p>I dont’t have a job at the moment. The scholarship is still going on. I’m learning everyday and having fun in the while. 
The main goal is always the same: to become a professional web developer. 
Keep that in mind always. Be persistent. Be patient.</p>

<p>If you are still in doubt, keep reading. What follows is my story with this scholarship.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>The Google Developer Scholarship is a program sponsored by Google and taught by Udacity.
Together, they have one mission: to reach out as many people as possible and promote code learning. 
In fact this program is available for residents in EU, Russia, Israel, Egypt and my beloved Turkey.</p>

<p>The entire program consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Challenge - or Phase One) and</li>
  <li>Nanodegree - or Phase Two);</li>
</ol>

<p>The 2017/2018 edition - the one I’m participatig to - consists in four learning paths:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Web development</strong> for beginners and intermediate</li>
  <li><strong>Android development</strong> for beginners and intermediate</li>
</ol>

<p>A great thing about it is that this year’s edition offers more opportunities than ever before. As a matter of fact each track offered 30.000 spots:
    * 20.000 for begginners
    * 10.000 for intermediate</p>

<p>Then, after this initial period, only top 10% students of each track could progress to the Phase 2. It means only 10% could access the full, six months-long program.</p>

<p>So from the initial 60000 people only 6000 got to the second phase.</p>

<h2 id="phase-one">Phase One</h2>
<p>It was an average October afternoon. I decided to check Facebook as it had been months since last time. I’m scrolling my feed and there I read about a Google Developer Scholarship opportunity.</p>

<p>I could’t believe it. Application was due by October 15, 2017.</p>

<p>There was a big chance here. I could continue to learn web development, I thought, but with all the good that came with this. It meant persistent mentoring, a guided path, a guarantee to learn from the best.</p>

<p>At first it was tough to think of a reason that would make me worthy of it. 
Then I calmed down, reasoned. I made already the decision to commit to coding and don’t look back. I was well aware I would commit body and soul to it, if accepted. This is what makes me worthy of it, I thought. Commitment. I had nothing to lose. Everything to gain.</p>

<p>So I spent the preceding weeks writing, deleting and rewriting my motivational letter.</p>

<p>October 15th arrived and it swallowed my application letter like a hungry, green blob. An email with my application status would arrive on MONDAY. 30th. OCTOBER.</p>

<p>Oh gosh.</p>

<p>The longest two weeks of my life. There were only few, blessed moments when I was not thinking about the announcement.</p>

<p>With all that anxiety in my body I didn’t sleep well the night before.</p>

<p>I wake up, it’s 5 AM.</p>

<p>I Check my email.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>An hour goes by.</p>

<p>I check again.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Anxiety rises.</p>

<p>Another hour and still nothing.</p>

<p>I start to rethink my existence.</p>

<p>The day goes on while nothing relevant comes into my inbox.</p>

<p>It’s 5 PM.</p>

<p>Exhausted, I check again a last time. Finally, there it was.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/gdswu/email-reject.webp" alt="GDN Rejection Email" /></p>

<p><strong>Rejected.</strong></p>

<p>I could not avoid to face how sad I was about it. It was like I hit a wall with my bare face.</p>

<p>The most successful people met failure along the way, I thought, so I had to keep learning. I had to be strong, practice everyday, all day long until I become good enough to get a job.</p>

<p>Two days later.</p>

<p>It’s evening. I and I see this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/gdswu/email-accept-p1.webp" alt="GDN Phase One - Accepted email" /></p>

<p>To this day I imagine a scholarship selector sitting on a chair making an evil laugh a la Montgomery Burns</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/gdswu/mrburns.webp" alt="Mr. Burns evil laugh" /></p>

<p>This scholarship challenge altered the way I see web development.</p>

<p>I discovered the other side of web development: to learn together with a community. It changed the way I see team work.</p>

<p>And you know why? Because good folks at Udacity decided to make participation to the community compulsory.</p>

<p>At the beginning it bothered me.</p>

<p>Because I’m an introvert person.</p>

<p>I used to avoid social interaction when possible. Day by day though, I started to see the true potential behind it. I saw why Udacity wanted us to interact and help each other.</p>

<p>Here I learned cooperative learning, mutual help, contribution to open source project. I learned the power of improving with people is the core heart of web development. The best part of it to be honest.</p>

<p>If I continued to learn alone I would have been a man in a cave who had never seen the world outside.</p>

<p>During this experience I learned the most and quickest I ever did in my life.</p>

<p>I grew both as a developer and as a person.</p>

<p>And for that I am grateful.</p>

<p>My plans have changed. I don’t want to only become a professional web developer. I want to be part of a greater reality than myself.
I want to be part of a greater community.</p>

<p>I want to live a meaningful life. I want to help other developers. I want to grow together with and connect to people around the world with code.</p>

<p>Together is better indeed.</p>

<p>There it was, Phase 1 finished. In two weeks we would have known who was going to Phase 2: the main dish.</p>

<h3 id="accepted">Accepted</h3>
<p>On February 14th - Valentine’s Day - I received this</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/gdswu/email-accept-p2.webp" alt="GDN Phase 2 - Accepted email" /></p>

<p>I love you Udacity.</p>

<p>I was so euphoric to read that message that I jumped all over the house. My neighbors must have thought I lost my mind.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-different">What is different</h3>
<p>These are the main differences between Phase One and Two:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Participation to community is not compulsory anymore. By this time Everyone learned the value behind it.</li>
  <li>With a new, dedicated Slack workspace. Students from all tracks converged here. Consider that there is 10% of the original 60.000 participants. It makes things way smoother, also community managers have an easier job to do now.</li>
  <li>Each student has a mentor who gives feedback on code, projects and the scholarship in general</li>
  <li>We can take advantage of Udacity’s career portal. It means we can receive 1:1 support to improve our professional profiles and for interviews.</li>
  <li>August 15 is the ultimate deadline to finish the program. If I can’t finish by that day I can’t     graduate. It makes sense we’re talking about a scholarship. 
Based on this there are <strong>recommended deadlines</strong> to submit projects. 
I take them as compulsory so that I can avoid piling things up. Plus, it’s important to meet deadlines in a working environment. 
Once a reviewer accepts my projects I build my own version. For example, these days I’m building my portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-new">What is new</h3>
<p>We are already a month into it and I am so excited for the following months. There are initiatives coming up, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>hackatons</li>
  <li>our community managers will spotlight the most outstanding  students on a weekly basis. Read more <a href="https://sites.google.com/knowlabs.com/gdnd2017/updates">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see there are opportunities everywhere if you are serious about coding. Use socials too. That’s how I found out about this scholarship.</p>

<p>Take the risk.</p>
