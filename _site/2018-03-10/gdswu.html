<p>You want to become a developer. I encourage you to look for new opportunities.</p>

<p>I don’t have a job at the moment. The scholarship is still going on. I’m learning every day and having fun in the while. 
The main goal is always the same: to become a professional web developer. 
Keep that in mind. Always. Be persistent. Be patient.</p>

<p>If you are still in doubt, continue to read. What follows is my story with this scholarship.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>The Google Developer Scholarship is a program sponsored by Google and taught by Udacity.
Together, they have one mission: to reach out as many people as possible and promote code learning. 
In fact this program is available for residents in EU, Russia, Israel, Egypt and my beloved Turkey.</p>

<p>The entire program consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Challenge</strong> - or Phase One - and</li>
  <li><strong>Nanodegree</strong> - or Phase Two;</li>
</ol>

<p>The 2017/2018 edition - the one I’m participating to - consists in four learning paths:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Web development</strong> for beginners and intermediate</li>
  <li><strong>Android development</strong> for beginners and intermediate</li>
</ul>

<p>A great thing about it is that this year’s edition offers more opportunities than ever before. As a matter of fact each track offered 30.000 spots:</p>
<ul>
  <li>20.000 for beginners</li>
  <li>10.000 for intermediate</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, after this initial period, only top 10% students of each track could progress to the Phase 2. It means only 10% could access the full, six months-long program.</p>

<p>So from the initial 60000 people <strong>only 6000</strong> got to the second phase.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-applied-to-phase-one">How I applied to Phase One</h2>

<p>It was an average October afternoon. I decided to check Facebook as it had been months since last time. I’m scrolling my feed and there I read about a Google Developer Scholarship opportunity.</p>

<p>Application was due by October 15, 2017.</p>

<p>There was a big chance here. I could continue to learn web development, I thought, but with all the good that came with this. It meant persistent mentoring, a guided path, a guarantee to learn from the best.</p>

<p>At first, it was tough to think of a reason that would make me worthy of it.</p>

<p>Then I calmed down, reasoned. I made already the decision to commit to coding and don’t look back. I was well aware I would dedicate body and soul to it, if accepted. This is what makes me worthy of it, I realized. Commitment. I had nothing to lose. Everything to gain.</p>

<p>So I spent the preceding weeks writing, deleting and rewriting my motivational letter.</p>

<p>October 15th arrived and it swallowed my application letter like a hungry, green blob. They inform me the selection result would arrive via email two weeks later.</p>

<p>Oh gosh.</p>

<p>The longest two weeks of my life. There were only few, blessed moments when I was not thinking about the announcement.</p>

<p>With all that anxiety in my body I didn’t sleep well the night before.</p>

<p>This is what I experienced.</p>

<p>I wake up, it’s 5 AM.</p>

<p>I Check my email.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>An hour goes by.</p>

<p>I check again.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Anxiety rises.</p>

<p>Another hour. Still nothing.</p>

<p>I start to rethink my existence.</p>

<p>The day goes on while nothing relevant comes into my inbox.</p>

<p>It’s 5 PM.</p>

<p>Exhausted, I check again a last time. Finally, there it was.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/gdswu/email-rejected.webp" alt="GDN rejected email" /></p>

<p><strong>Rejected.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/gdswu/homer-heart-attack.webp" alt="Homer heart attack" /></p>

<p>I could not avoid facing how sad I was about it. It was like I hit a wall with my bare face.</p>

<p>The most successful people met failure along the way, I thought, so I had to keep learning. I had to be strong, practice every day, all day long until I become good enough to get a job.</p>

<p>Two days later I see this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/gdswu/email-accepted-p1.webp" alt="GDN Phase One - Accepted email" /></p>

<p>A mistake.</p>

<p>I felt like Homer here,  when he had a heart attack and was transition between his body and heaven.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/gdswu/homer-transition.webp" alt="Homer transition" /></p>

<p>To this day I imagine a scholarship selector sitting on a chair making an evil laugh a la Montgomery Burns</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/gdswu/mrburns.webp" alt="Mr. Burns evil laugh" /></p>

<h2 id="what-ive-learned">What I’ve learned</h2>
<p>This scholarship challenge altered the way I see web development.</p>

<p>I discovered the other side of web development: to learn together with a community. It changed the way I see team work.</p>

<p>And you know why? Because good folks at Udacity decided to make participation to the community compulsory.</p>

<p>At the beginning it bothered me because I’m introvert by nature.</p>

<p>I used to avoid social interaction when possible. Day by day though, I started to see the true potential behind it. I saw why Udacity wanted us to interact and help each other.</p>

<p>Here I learned cooperative learning, mutual help, contribution to open source project. I learned the power of improving with people is the core heart of web development. The best part of it to be honest.</p>

<p>If I continued to learn alone I would have been a man in a cave who had never seen the world outside.</p>

<p>During this experience I learned the most and quickest I ever did in my life.</p>

<p>I grew both as a developer and as a person.</p>

<p>And for that I am grateful.</p>

<p>My plans have changed. I don’t want to only become a professional web developer. 
I want also to be part of a greater reality than myself.
I want to be part of a greater community. 
I want to live a meaningful life. 
I want to help other developers. 
I want to grow together with and connect to people around the world with code.</p>

<p>Together is better indeed.</p>

<p>There it was, Phase 1 finished. In two weeks we would have known who was going to Phase 2: the main dish.</p>

<h2 id="phase-two">Phase Two</h2>
<p>On February 14th - Valentine’s Day - I received this</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/gdswu/email-accepted-p2.webp" alt="GDN Phase 2 - Accepted email" /></p>

<p>I love you Udacity.</p>

<p>I was so euphoric to read that message that I jumped all over the house. My neighbors must have thought I lost my mind.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-different">What is different</h2>
<p>Here is what:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Participation to community is not compulsory anymore</strong>. By this time everyone learned the value behind it;</li>
  <li><strong>A new, dedicated Slack workspace</strong>. Recipients from all tracks converged here. Consider that there is 10% of the original 60.000 participants. It makes things way smoother. Also, community managers have an easier job to do now;</li>
  <li><strong>Each student has a mentor</strong> who gives feedback on code, projects and the scholarship in general;</li>
  <li><strong>We can take advantage of Udacity’s career portal</strong>. It means we can receive 1 on 1 support to improve our professional profiles and prepare for interviews.</li>
  <li><strong>August 15</strong> is the ultimate deadline to finish the program. I can’t graduate if I don’t finish all the projects by then. It makes sense: we’re talking about a scholarship after all. 
Based on this there are <strong>recommended deadlines</strong> to submit projects. 
I take them as compulsory so that I can avoid piling things up. Plus, it’s important to meet deadlines in a working environment. 
Once a reviewer accepts my projects I build my own version. For example, these days I’m building my own portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-new">What is new</h2>
<p>We are already almost month into it and I am so excited for the weeks to come. There are initiatives coming up, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>two <strong>webinars</strong> on March 21 an 22 to talk about life after graduation</li>
  <li>two <strong>hackatons</strong> for Android tracks on April 14-15;</li>
  <li>two <strong>hackatons</strong> for Web development tracks on April 21-22;</li>
  <li>our community managers will <strong>spotlight</strong> the most outstanding students on a weekly basis. Read more <a href="https://sites.google.com/knowlabs.com/gdnd2017/updates">here</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>As you can see there are opportunities everywhere if you are serious about coding. Use socials too. That’s how I found out about this scholarship.</p>

<p><strong>Take the risk</strong>.</p>
