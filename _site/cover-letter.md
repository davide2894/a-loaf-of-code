Dear recruiters at Roll Studio (Avellino),


please let me introduce myself. My name is Davide Iaiunese (quite a tongue-twister for a surname, I know). I have been self-teaching web development since last September. Since October, I've been a Google Developer Scholarship recipient. 


As the scholarship is approaching its end - in August - and as I am growing more confident of my skills, I started looking for a job. 


A few days ago, I read a message from Ms Luisa Tatoli about your current need of a developer. I'm interested in this position because, as I am eager to start a professional career in this field, I see the passion and enthusiasm radiated by your company.


I'm the right candidate for you because I am committed. I want to make web development the career for my life.


Give me the opportunity and you will have 200% of me in return. 


Even if now I don't have all the skills required, I can assure you that, with time, I will learn them all.


Passion, hunger for solving problems and long-term commitment are valuable qualities I offer to you, in exchange for an opportunity. 


I am willing to relocate.


Yours sincerely,
Davide Iaiunese
