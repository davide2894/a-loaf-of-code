Hi! I'm Davide Iaiunese - I know I know, a tongue-twister for a last name, right? - and I am a Front-End Web Developer. 

This is a place to tell the chronicles of my adventure in this fantastic field. 

Recently I have been selected to receive a full Google Developer Scholarship, I'm so excited for what is to come so fasten your seatbelts: this journey just started!
