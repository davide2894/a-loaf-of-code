Hi! I'm Davide Iaiunese - I know I know, a tongue-twister for a last name, right? - I am a Front-End Web Developer. 

Why another coding blog? I want to document my journey to professional web development, I want to prove that it's possible and that everybody can. And while I do it I want to contribute to our learning, to grow together.

This is a place to tell the chronicles of my adventure in this fantastic field.
