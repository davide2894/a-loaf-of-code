For the sake of fun, I made a Magic card replica in pure CSS and some other tools. It took longer than expected to be honest, buy this was a good, entertaining way to practice code and improve myself.

## Those some other tools
I took the opportunity to experiment a bit with tools speficically aimed for this project and others, such as Gulp, that I know I will use in future projects as well. All in all, here's what I used
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io): text editor
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com): task-automation 
* [Keyrune](https://github.com/andrewgioia/Keyrune) for the expansion font 
* [Mana](https://github.com/andrewgioia/Mana) font  
* [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org): image editing

## This is the original card:
