This is the third part in the Dragon Ball-based, memory game walkthrough series. If you haven't already, read [PART 1](https://codeburst.io/how-to-make-a-dragon-ball-memory-game-part-1-91f40ba268dd) and [PART 2](https://codeburst.io/how-to-make-a-dragon-ball-memory-game-part-2-5659ff2ee0b9).

## Recap
Two weeks ago, right at the beginning of this project, we sstarted by laying down the game HTML structure, a raw one to be honest. Then we started building the main attraction of this game: cards. Well, we started with just one. In fact, we made that one, first card flippable by using JavaScript.

Last week, with [PART 2](https://codeburst.io/how-to-make-a-dragon-ball-memory-game-part-2-5659ff2ee0b9), we took the first card and made 15 copies out of it. As a result, we noticed how horrible and gigantous those cards looked, so we made the smaller, added some Flexbox and made it all look prettier. Lastly, we channeled our attention to add a function that would shuffle the card. It's working and we tested it.

That said, we can move with this new, exciting third part! :D

## Move counter
Having worked pretty much only on the card part, let's shake things up a bit a focus on the score panel this time.
