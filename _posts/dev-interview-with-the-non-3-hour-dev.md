Q: Sure. So as a start, tell me a bit about yourself
A: Hi, I am Non Umemoto, a Japanese indie app developer from Tokyo.
I make a living by selling my apps on the AppStore and the Playstore.  
I do everything related to app developments including programming, UI design, and supports.
P.S. What does your name mean?

Q: That's interesting. Tell me more please. How did it all start?
A: About 7 years ago, I was a person who always wanted to make a web service, 
but don't have programming skill to do that.

I failed to learn PHP twice at the time but finally succeeded by making what I want and tried to learn based on things just for that purpose.
After making 3 web services, I wanted to make an app who listen to the web blogs on the go,
so I started learning iOS programming, then made the first app called Lisgo.

Since then, I've been developing and maintaining several mobile apps.

PS:
My name Non is quite unique for Japanese, it means warm in Japanese. :)

Q: Stubbornness is an incredible quality to have Non. In all honesty, I think a person can't do this profession if he is used to give up on the first fail.

Could you describe the process you went through to publish and sell Lisgo? Also, could you could you provide a link for it?

A: Sure, but Lisgo is not on the AppStore anymore, 
I made a new app called [Voicepaper](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1273954643) recently which is a new TTS app for Lisgo users.

Having said that, I started learning iPhone dev using books and the net at first, and 
I released the first version after around 6 months or so.

This was an app which I wanted to use myself, so I knew what are most important functions, and something I can add later from the start.
Actually, I always make apps I use by myself so far, and this is a good and natural advantage as an indie app developer.

After I released the app, I tried to listen to feedback from users as much as possible to find out what people need and what people don't need so much as I predicted before.

I learned a lot from the first app about how I can design and develop apps and how I can monetize it.

Q: 6 months, I'm impressed. Usually, does it take so long to release an app?. And back then, were you already implementing the 3-hour-of-coding principle?
