Q: Sure. So as a start, tell me a bit about yourself
A: Hi, I am Non Umemoto, a Japanese indie app developer from Tokyo.
I make a living by selling my apps on the AppStore and the Playstore.  
I do everything related to app developments including programming, UI design, and supports.
P.S. What does your name mean?

Q: That's interesting. Tell me more please. How did it all start?
A: About 7 years ago, I was a person who always wanted to make a web service, 
but don't have programming skill to do that.

I failed to learn PHP twice at the time but finally succeeded by making what I want and tried to learn based on things just for that purpose.
After making 3 web services, I wanted to make an app who listen to the web blogs on the go,
so I started learning iOS programming, then made the first app called Lisgo.

Since then, I've been developing and maintaining several mobile apps.

PS:
My name Non is quite unique for Japanese, it means warm in Japanese. :)

Q: Stubbornness is an incredible quality to have Non. In all honesty, I think a person can't do this profession if he is used to give up on the first fail.

Could you describe the process you went through to publish and sell Lisgo? Also, could you could you provide a link for it?

A: Sure, but Lisgo is not on the AppStore anymore, 
I made a new app called [Voicepaper](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1273954643) recently which is a new TTS app for Lisgo users.

Having said that, I started learning iPhone dev using books and the net at first, and 
I released the first version after around 6 months or so.

This was an app which I wanted to use myself, so I knew what are most important functions, and something I can add later from the start.
Actually, I always make apps I use by myself so far, and this is a good and natural advantage as an indie app developer.

After I released the app, I tried to listen to feedback from users as much as possible to find out what people need and what people don't need so much as I predicted before.

I learned a lot from the first app about how I can design and develop apps and how I can monetize it.

///

Q: 6 months, I'm impressed. Usually, does it take so long to release an app?. And back then, were you already implementing the 3-hour-of-coding principle?  

A: I try to release a first minimal version as fast as I can since you never know if people will like it or not till you release it on the AppStore.
Especially, you cannot tell if people pay for your app until you release it.

So, I usually try to release a new app within 3-6 months after I started developing it from scratch.
After I release the first version, if I see people pay for the app, I will start polishing it based on user feedback.
It will take more time to upgrade after releasing it anyway if I keep updating it.


>>were you already implementing the 3-hour-of-coding principle?  
I worked hard at the first 2 or 3 years, around 6-8 hours programming every day for a full year, 
and I burned out after that.

Especially I had sore eyes every time back then, and I decided to make a 3-hour working principle later.


Q: sore eyes are a problem that affected me as well. I had to take some measures to fix that problem, like installing Redlight on Ubuntu, setting dark themes for everything, exercising and so on. 

So this was what made you transition to a 3-hour coding day. Was it a direct transition or it was a gradual change?

A: I started working up to 6 hours per day at first, but I felt I still have some time when I am not focusing enough while working for 6 hours.
I mean, if I have enough time for work, I tend to do something not important during my work time like searching for something or checking SNS.

After trying 6 hours rule per day for about 6 months, I decided to try 3 hours a day rule.
I found I really think about what I need to do and I shouldn't do with this rule more than before, and 
I keep doing this since then.

***

Q: What's your daily routine?
A: Usually, I start doing my work for 3 hours straight after I wake up since I have the most energy at the time.
I do everything related to my work including programming, support, marketing stuff and so on for that time, and I will do the rest next day.

After I finished my working time, I start doing anything related to my life like doing chores, and other things.

I keep following this routine on holidays too, but sometimes I cannot work at all when I want to do something else with someone, I am traveling or sick.

Q: Damn, that sounds too good Non! Are you really more productive with only 3 hours of daily work? If so, can you give us an example, please?
