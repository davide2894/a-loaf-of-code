Q: Sure. So as a start, tell me a bit about yourself
A: Hi, I am Non Umemoto, a Japanese indie app developer from Tokyo.
I make a living by selling my apps on the AppStore and the Playstore.  
I do everything related to app developments including programming, UI design, and supports.
P.S. What does your name mean?

Q: That's interesting. Tell me more please. How did it all start?
A: About 7 years ago, I was a person who always wanted to make a web service, 
but don't have programming skill to do that.

I failed to learn PHP twice at the time but finally succeeded by making what I want and tried to learn based on things just for that purpose.
After making 3 web services, I wanted to make an app who listen to the web blogs on the go,
so I started learning iOS programming, then made the first app called Lisgo.

Since then, I've been developing and maintaining several mobile apps.

PS:
My name Non is quite unique for Japanese, it means warm in Japanese. :)
