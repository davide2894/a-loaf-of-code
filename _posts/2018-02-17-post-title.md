## Look out, Itchy! He's Irish!

Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.

1. Save me, Jeebus.
2. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.
3. Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.

### Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.

Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?* Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.

* I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.
* Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.
* Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention!

```javascript
var greeting = "Hello";

function say(greeting){
    return greeting + " World"!;
}
```
